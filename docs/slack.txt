@will for the textbooks in the sheet, what is the expectation on the environment? A dataset of all questions and tools to solve it?
Max Brashear — 8/27/25, 4:23 PM
Congrats on the launch! We've been cooking up a couple of environments on our end - excited to share them soon
Mika — 8/27/25, 4:25 PM
to be confirmed by @will, but we imagine envs with qa pairs from the textbooks. ideally answers are official (we haven't specifically checked this for all books in the list yet). env should ofc include necessary parsing logic to correctly verify llm responses etc. but this should not be the difficult part
Johannes — 8/27/25, 4:25 PM
the textbook ones were inspired by this tweet btw 🙂 https://x.com/karpathy/status/1960805995313291488

Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)
How amazing it would be if we could extract and reframe all the practice problems from all the textbooks ever written into environments...

definitely more open ended on what's the best way to create envs + datasets for them, so if anyone is interested in this kinda project or wants to find a more semi-automated process for it, definitely apply here: https://form.typeform.com/to/ibQawo5e

Hey,
I was trying to implement WebArena and WebChoreArena envs for the hub.
I need to deploy some websites for the LLMs to navigate for the eval. The authors of the papers had done this on Amazon EC2 instances. I talked to @will  and he suggested to do it on sandbox for the env. I require the hostname for the server with the deployment, to be given the LLM as part of the url. Check this for reference: https://github.com/web-arena-x/webarena/tree/main/environment_docker#shopping-website-onestopshop

What would be the hostnam for deployment on the sandbox?
Also, I am making multilingual evals for the env. Currently raised PR for Qwen Polymath benchmark. For measuring language consistency (i.e. if the model is responding in the langauge of the question), I am currently langid. I tried using fasttext, but it requires C++ compilers but I was unsure if the env will have those. So should I switch to langid or switch to some other language classifier? 
Sinatras — 8/27/25, 5:19 PM
Started working on pmpp but as you said its open ended since these are not ready evals. Sequence will be, dataset -> eval -> prime env still will submit arhitecture as WIP i guess
Goliath — 8/27/25, 5:20 PM
something that isnt obvious from the instructions on the website: execute "uv run prime env install [package]" then "uv run python" to ensure the python env is the same across installation and execution when using an env 
otherwise you run into an issue "Could not import X environment. Ensure the package for the X environment is installed."
tikwurp — 8/27/25, 5:27 PM
thanks, but this still does not work if you want to use prime-rl for training it seems
getting the same "Could not import X environment. error

is your env using some specific library that most other libraries might have? try confirming if the env.toml file has the necessary libraries in it
lazyg — 8/27/25, 6:12 PM
Alternatively, run uv sync in the directory to find out where your environment is or to create one in the current directory if it contains a pyproject.toml

textbook one is likely a longer-term project / will be sharing more info shortly about how we're planning on coordinating these (there's a few we have in mind)

I created a question extraction workflow earlier by sending pdf pages as images and getting structured output. Could potentially reuse it 
will — 8/27/25, 6:25 PM
TLDR: if you've already done a few great environment impls so far + want more "work", we have some opportunities for you to go deeper on some longer-term projects (give us a couple days to catch up with everything first though :))

at this point we're probably going to have the smaller/easier bounties reserved for first-time contributors, to ensure that as many people as possible get ample opportunities to pitch in + get some bounties

how can i install from git URL? if i have balrog @ git+https://github.com/balrog-ai/BALROG.git in pyproject.toml and push it, i am getting following error when trying to install.
Failed to resolve dependencies for balrog-prime (v0.1.0)

can i do runtime install? i not able to build a wheel and pushing it to pypi for https://github.com/balrog-ai/BALROG.git   because it has dependencies installed from urls and so does the dependencies  of it. if i build wheel and push recursively, it will be a nightmare to maintain.

@will  hey!  for the scicode environment whose tests rely on an external HDF5 for numeric targets, what’s the right way to handle that so it works in eval? 
will — 8/28/25, 3:06 PM
great q, generally i’d recommend at least including a setup script in the env for the target, and best if it’s possible to have it triggered at the start of load_environment (ideally only running expensive operations once + caching results locally)

I have an environment that takes these args:
def load_environment(
    kind: Literal["train", "test"] = "test",
    num_train: int = 10000,
    num_eval: int = 1000,
    num_test: int = 1000,
    use_think: bool = True,
)

It is runnig perfectly with this command:
uv run vf-eval clutrr -m my-model -n 3 -r 2

But giving error with this:
uv run vf-eval clutrr -m my-model -n 10 -r 2 -a '{"kind": "test", "num_test": 10, "use_think": true}'

The error is:
vf-eval: error: argument --env-args/-a: invalid loads value: '{kind: test, num_test:10, use_think:true}'

What can be the reason for this?
Also, the when I run with "-n 3", I only get for 3 samples, not the 1000 value that is set as default for num_test. So -n is probably overwriting over my num_test arg anyway. Why is this and can this be the reason for my error?
oso — 8/28/25, 7:33 PM
Does true in the dict need to be capitalized?
oso — 8/28/25, 7:34 PM
Why not just drop the -n flag if you have a custom arg?

we will also add a tag for each env on the hub in the next couple days which shows if the environments properly loads or not to make it more obvious which environment is still work in progress

tikwurp — 8/28/25, 10:26 PM
yes this environment works! I think the code snippet you sent is not correct because it's for the non beta version? 
if i do

$ uv run prime env install ibrahim/terminal-bench-beta@0.2.2
$ python
>>> from verifiers import load_environment
>>> env = load_environment('terminal-bench-beta')

this works 🤔 
tikwurp — 8/28/25, 10:27 PM
thanks a lot! what makes the RL envs not functional? even if they seem to be installed in the venv 
Goliath — 8/28/25, 10:29 PM
ok i pushed v0.2.2 i think it was probably related to the includes in the pyproject.toml not exposing the file that had load_environment

whether or not load_environment runs without errors mostly, which installing doesn’t check

CI is part of our whole web app backend which isn't easy to contribute to really, private repo

I would like to start working on environmets for books, for example scaling your model. In the prompt, do you think I also should include the text of the chapter (so the theory) the problem is extracted from or not?  Including the theory would let us isolate pure reasoning, while not including would means also rewarding good recall/memory. For advanced math books I think you csn't go without chapters because defitions and conventions are too specific

Anyway, i'm working on a benchmark that gets LLMs to assemble and create redstone contraptions (they have to collect the materials first) and I estimate it will take models several hours to complete it (I'm basing this estimation on 'claude plays pokemon'), so it will be really nice to have some widely used harness for compaction.

bruno — 8/29/25, 11:59 AM
hi everyone. wanted to know if anyone has seen something like this and what did you do to solve it. I'm porting ACEBench and the original has lots of different cases, each one with (sometimes subtle, sometimes not) differences on parsing and/or rubrics. I implemented each major case as a single env to help me understand each one (and to use AI more efficiently)

now i'm packing up the env to open the PR to review, and i'm not sure if this is the best way to do it. I think i could easily merge acebench_normal_* (maybe even with the special case together) but i'm not so sure about acebench_agent_* ones. 

i'd be really happy with any help or input on this! i'm currently thinking of merge normal and special together but don't know what to do with the agent ones. 

may be valid to consider that one could want to train/eval just on one or another case, they benchmark different things (even tho all of them are roughly benchmarking tool-use) 
Image
bruno — 8/29/25, 12:14 PM
from their paper: 

>"Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues.
mauri — 8/29/25, 12:24 PM
I'm not the best for review since I haven't written an env (yet), but I would recommend sharing the branch here so others can get an idea of the current code structure. It's hard to make suggestions based only on filenames.
bruno — 8/29/25, 12:31 PM
appreciate the suggestion! https://github.com/ob1-s/prime-environments/tree/add-acebench-env
each env shares a lot of common code! 
dhruvrnaik — 8/29/25, 4:56 PM
@will The convert_func_to_oai_tool util in verifiers is quite limited -> it does not create the right json schema for complex type hints.

example:
List[str] or list[str] gets turned into "type": "string", when it should be "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}.

In my draft, I am going around this by explicitly writing the  json schema, but I don't think that is good solution.

agents-sdk has a good function_schema util, could we use that directly in the verifiers implementation for ToolEnv?

My PR: https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-environments/pull/75/files#diff-ef3d5dba56fc2ee6a6ad23217e59ee505f73c55fd08e343ded18daafb4410f47R155

will — 8/29/25, 5:03 PM
ah, good thing to flag, thanks. for now, you could use the openai-agents sdk to create the proper schema and override? generally hesitant to introduce new dependencies but this may be a good justification for doing so (i know some people use langchain for this, but that's so heavyweight of an import, agents-sdk should be more minimal)
dhruvrnaik — 8/29/25, 5:04 PM
Doing something like
from agents.function_schema import function_schema

function_schema_obj = function_schema(search_inbox)

schema = {
    "name": function_schema_obj.name,
    "description": function_schema_obj.description,
    "parameters": function_schema_obj.params_json_schema,
    "strict_json_schema": function_schema_obj.strict_json_schema,
    "type": "function",
}


Also found https://github.com/comfuture/function-schema, but was not as flexible as agent-sdk
will — 8/29/25, 5:04 PM
e.g.

env = vf.ToolEnv(tools=tools, ...)
env.oai_tools = [function_schema(tool).model_dump() for tool in tools]
dhruvrnaik — 8/29/25, 5:06 PM
yup, agreed. Another option would be to copy the core logic of the util to verifiers (with ack) and avoid new dependencies.
will — 8/29/25, 5:10 PM

StepFunProver implementation is finally done will clean things up and refactor PR for visuals, but yea async container calls/rubrick and running lean was painful with bunch of race conditions till now but fixed from now on. As the problem of this env is really hard uploaded results will be lower than what initially can be expected but even 
deepseek-prover-v2
 cannot fix most of the lean4 problems within dataset (pretty pricey to run since iterations over env run/feeback consume a lot tokens). Which is goodnews on the side which means there is headroom for RL to improve this domain clearly 📈

yeah this is tricky, you’re welcome to skip any sub calls to docker for now, neither us nor any of the other sandbox offerings i’m familiar with has great support for it afaik
in this case a simplified version of the bench is totally fine

hey actually ended up building a version which spins up a pod instead of sandbox by looking at the api and commands implementations and execute commands/folder upload/download using ssh/scp. Is that fine as well?

@will not sure if you got the notif, could you check my PR (scicode)?

@will  I also have a PR for AidanBench, on a subset of questions I reproduce around same score reported by the paper on 4o mini
will — 8/31/25, 4:55 AM
Can you put it up on prime-environments? Lots of PRs to review, working through em 🙂 prioritizing those which follow all the guidelines mentioned (see other PRs) and for which a bounty had been promised
(saw it was on verifiers; we have another repo for collecting envs, you can also just upload on the Hub without needing a PR)

hey is there any way to ensure the rubrics are evaluated in a particular order for a group??
and maybe some groups in parallel, is groups of groups supported
?
bruno — 8/31/25, 10:45 AM
RubricGroup rubrics are already processed sequentially (in the order you defined them), is that what you meant?

https://github.com/willccbb/verifiers/blob/4daa4b39e879de5d8988deb1a413f3411412b40c/verifiers/rubrics/rubric_group.py#L60
bruno — 8/31/25, 10:49 AM
within a Rubric the rewards are processed in parallel by default. not sure about parallel groups tho. 

 is groups of groups supported
yes, it is. but afaik within each RubricGroup the rubrics will still be processed sequentially

Hey thanks I was looking for more like of you imagine a tree of rubrics then level order traversal witch each level processing together ( using parallel judge llm calls ) is that possible?
bruno — 8/31/25, 10:52 AM
i don't think it's possible natively, but you could create a custom RubricGroup class

Hi guys, I'm working on the wiki-race env, and needed some advice!

It's for the bounty on the wikibench benchmark which has this scoring methodology from the blog: 
"
Scoring
I decided on golf scoring — the lower the score/more efficent the path, the better. Each click or path step counted as a point. Theoretically a model that gets from bradawl to Kevin Bacon in 5 clicks, and describes this path perfectly, gets a score of 5. To account for Wikipedia editorial oversight and model psychology, we apply a series of sliding-scale penalties and modifiers to the final score:
   
+10 for an invalid path (link to step B is not mentioned in article A)
+5 for invalid path with mention to account for Wikipedia editorial oversight.

For example, the article for Screwdriver mentions the United States by name, but doesn’t link to the article itself even though it probably should. A human wouldn’t make that mistake and assume it could click a nonexistent link, so it deserves a penalty, but Wikipedia isn’t perfect and we can partially reward the model’s ability to recognize that connection.
    
+7 for invalid path, conceptually related but not mentioned, for non-tool use models; e.g., bradawl doesn’t link to carpentry, but it does to carpenter.
+6 for if the model hits a length limit but has a valid path to that point.
+15 for giving up. Wikipedia is a connected graph; a valid solution does exist.
+20 for cheating. Only one model did this! (Can you guess which one?)
-1 for a particularly creative valid connection; i.e., a leap that no other models made.
"

In the instructions for completing evals it says to be pretty strict about following the original scoring methods, a lo of these don't really seem conducive with how verifiers rewards work.

For example it rewards creativity by comparing outputs from multiple different models running on the eval, that's not really possible. 

How much do i need to follow their implementation/scoring? Is it fine to not do golf scoring but convert it to a more standard scoring system with how other verfiers env do things? With this bounty on the excel sheet i was also linked to 'hugginface/wikirace-llms' which does a diffren't format of showing the model links and getting it to pick one rather than guessing a chain based on the starting article (which seemed more appealing to me) but the two sources have such diffren't implementations I'm not sure how much creative freedom I have? Should I use the wikibench blog as the way I NEED to do it? 

Sorry for rambling, and thanks for any help/advice!

Hello, finalized https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments/sinatras/stepfun-prover there is a issue while pushing the dockerfile, its not getting pushed via  
prime env push
 any tips on it ? its already in pyproject file

I added this functionality and made a PR for this

Johannes — 8/31/25, 12:41 PM
sick! will take a look in a sec!
alexine — 8/31/25, 2:25 PM
@will  made the changes on the PR, should be good now. also, I ran into a bug along the way, so I opened a PR for verifiers (tui) as well 
Big sol — 8/31/25, 2:46 PM
So what's good
bruno — 8/31/25, 3:46 PM
it would also be nice if the hub's code explorer had a "copy permalink" feature like in github, it'd make sharing code easier, esp. for envs with lots of LOCs;

and on the hub's main page, i think if we had a way to sort envs (e.g. by creation time) would really help on discoverability

tagging @Johannes in case this is useful

Hey,
I made PRs for a few multilingual evals on the github. Right now I have added the languages supported in the README. I was thinking can we add language filters on the hub or alternatively should I add all languaages as tags?
oso — 8/31/25, 3:53 PM
hey all, if anyone was using the homoglyph corruption tool i shared earlier, i've made some updates to the logic as well as added another type of corruptor (typos on a QWERTY keyboard), with more to come. have fun, meet the glitchlings: https://github.com/osoleve/glitchlings
bruno — 8/31/25, 3:59 PM
btw, i think the evals page's table sort is not working. it works for model but not for avg reward or run date
Image
uuuh just notice run date is showing the date/hour i pushed to the hub, not the eval run's itself. is that right? @Johannes (not sure who to ping)
Johannes — 8/31/25, 5:21 PM
great feedback, shared it with the team! we will incorporate this over the next week!
Johannes — 8/31/25, 5:26 PM
yess that's right
this will improve soonish because we will add a way that it automatically runs evals for most envs for a selected range of models when you push it to the hub. we had quite a few inference providers reach out that were interested in doing this with us.
bruno — 8/31/25, 5:27 PM
good to know!

hey any reference as to what should we use for a web browser tool?
for computer use
click refresh scroll etc.
Mika — 9/1/25, 5:45 AM
im not sure myself, @will might have opinions
will — 9/1/25, 11:18 AM
browserbase/stagehand and browser-use are probably best options 
browser-use if you want self-hosted
browserbase for API

Hello Will, StepFunProver is ready on PR there is a small issue with pushed env which i mentioned here do you have any tips on fixing it ?
will — 9/1/25, 11:23 AM
totally flexible on scoring system for edge cases here + creative freedom, will trust your judgment, deviate from wikibench blog as much as needed. 

in general, I'd avoid trying to be too clever with rewarding for "partial credit". fine to give a 0 if a model doesn't give a valid path. ideally the model can explore incrementally, ie it always can see the list of valid outgoing links from its current page, and thus wouldn't need to "guess a perfect path"
Goliath — 9/1/25, 11:56 AM
prime-environments main branch fails the tests unfortunately, noticed it when i was updating my fork 
lazyg — 9/1/25, 11:56 AM
+1, letting it figure out based on new knowledge on every click is a better bench
Luc — 9/1/25, 3:11 PM
That’s how I have it set up, it sees a list of links available and chooses one then gets the next sets of links from chosen page in a multi turn fashion, I’ll take ur advice on partial rewards and tweak it a bit and submit it then, thanks Will!
will — 9/1/25, 5:51 PM
ah yeah we aren't really intending for full test coverage/enforcing passing there, it's somewhat useful to see issues but not something we're actively maintaining

hi @will what's with open bounties on textbooks? What do we have to do exactly? Scrape the entire book to generate Q&A or only questions that are at the end of each chapter?

What’s the smallest model that I can reliably use for random experiments? Does qwen3-8b suffice? And if so, What’s the recommended cluster setup? I would like to RL train a model and start experimenting
Mika — 12:48 AM
we have done most of our smaller experiments on qwen3-1.7b or qwen3-8b, if you have the compute 8b is usually more stable and more fun to play with. if you dont want to do crazy ctx size, a single node should suffice

Like this modify env name, base url, api key in env variable and model name

Thankyou so much! any way to get a model running to test it out? do i have to deploy a vllm instance on thew portal?

you can choose to hit an api model via your fav provider or self-host. if self-hosting, prime compute + vllm is a good choice:)

Hi all, I'm working on a simple xgboost trainer env. https://gist.github.com/stangirala/847e3de99b47dc335657bae8d867577f

Looking at the wikipedia search example from the repo, this gist code is,
Creating a tool evaluate_params to train an xgb model and emit metrics.
Calls a gpt 4.1 judge using the judge rubric to test out the dataset prompt Has the metric for dataset improved, regression-data-set1?.

I'm still figuring out the dataflow for the verifiers/environments package. I wanted to check if this gist looks good or if I've misunderstood something with the interaction protocol.

From the lib code, I'm not able to figure out how we can save state across different runs of the tool. I don't think I saw an example of ‎StatefulToolEnv in the repo. Seems like multi-turn env might be the way here.

@Johannes would it suffice to get the problems in .csv format (columns: book, chapter, problem_number, problem_statement) from a huggingface table? I used grok to give me the .md format of problems in the book so then I  check and can convert to .csv and put on huggingface to be loaded on an env.
